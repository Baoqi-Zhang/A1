# ## Question 1: Estimating $\pi$ [8 marks]
# 
# Consider the 3 following formulas:
# 
# $$
# \begin{align}
# (1) \qquad &\prod_{n=1}^\infty \frac{4n^2}{4n^2-1} = \frac{\pi}{2} \\
# (2) \qquad &\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2^n n!^2}{(2n+1)!} = \frac{\pi}{2} \\
# (3) \qquad &\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n(n+1)(2n+1)} = \pi - 3
# \end{align}
# $$
# 
# Each of these formulas can be used to compute the value of $\pi$ to arbitrary precision, by computing as many terms of the partial sum or product as are required.
# 
# **1.1** Compute the sum or product of the first $m$ terms for each formula, with $m = 1, 2, 3, \dots, 30$.
# 
# Present your results graphically, using 2 plots, both with the total number of terms on the x-axis.
# 
# - The first plot should display the value of the partial sum or product for different numbers of terms, and clearly indicate the exact value of $\pi$ for reference.
# - The second plot should display the absolute value of the error between the partial sum or product and $\pi$, with the y-axis set to logarithmic scale.

# **1.2** If you did not have access to e.g. `np.pi` or `math.pi`, which of these 3 formulas would you choose to efficiently calculate an approximation of $\pi$ accurate to within any given precision (down to machine accuracy -- i.e. not exceeding $\sim 10^{-16}$)?
# 
# Explain your reasoning in your own words, with reference to your plots from **1.1**, in no more than 200 words.
# 
# **[3 marks]**

# Formula 2 is the most efficient way of calculating an approximation of pi since the absolute error is decreasing constantly with a relatively large gradient compared with the other two formulas. It does not converge in the interval[0,30] These two facts tell me that using formula 2, the difference between the estimation and true value of pi will become Negligibly small in the end.
# 
# The other two formulas are experiencing similar trend in the whole process: converging over time. The errors are still quite obvious at the end of the plot.
# 
# Another interesting point is that although the formula 2 is quite far from the actual value of pi at first, its approximation finally exceeds the other two approximation.

# ## Question 2: Numerical Linear Algebra [12 marks]
# 
# A **block-diagonal matrix** is a square matrix with square blocks of non-zero values along the diagonal, and zeros elsewhere. For example, the following matrix A is an example of a block-diagonal matrix of size $7\times 7$, with 3 diagonal blocks of size $2\times 2$, $3\times 3$, and $2 \times 2$ respectively:
# 
# $$
# A =
# \begin{pmatrix}
# 1 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
# 2 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
# 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\
# 0 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
# 0 & 0 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 0 & 0 \\
# 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 & -2 \\
# 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 & 3
# \end{pmatrix}.
# $$
# 
# 
# **2.1** The code below creates a block-diagonal matrix with random non-zero values between 0 and 1, where all blocks have identical size. Study the following documentation sections:
# 
# - [`scipy.linalg.block_diag()` - SciPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.block_diag.html)
# - [`numpy.split()` - NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.split.html)
# - [Unpacking Argument Lists - Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists)
# 
# Then, write detailed code comments in the cell below to explain **each line** of code, in your own words.

# 
# We assume that all diagonal blocks $A_i$ are invertible, and therefore that the matrix $A$ is also invertible.

# - a NumPy vector `b` of length $mn$.
# 
# Your function should solve the block-diagonal system $Ax = b$, by solving **each sub-system $A_i x_i = b_i$ separately**, and return the solution as a NumPy vector `x` of length $mn$. You should choose an appropriate method seen in the course (e.g. `np.linalg.solve()`) to solve each sub-system.

# 
# - solving the sub-systems one at a time, as in **2.2**,
# - solving the full system with a general method, not attempting to take the block-diagonal structure into account.
# 
# Consider block-diagonal systems with block sizes $n = 5, 10, 15, 20$, and a total number $m = 5, 10, 15, \dots, 40$ of blocks. For each combination of $n$ and $m$:
# 
# - Use the function `random_blocks()` from **2.1** to generate a list of $m$ random matrices of size $n\times n$.
# - Use the function `np.random.random()` to generate a random vector `b` of length $mn$.
# - Use your function `linsolve_block_diag()` from **2.2** to solve the system $Ax = b$, where $A$ is a block-diagonal matrix of size $mn \times mn$, with diagonal blocks given by the output of `random_blocks()`. Measure the computation time needed to solve the system.
# - Use the function `block_diag()` from `scipy.linalg` to form a NumPy array `A` of size $mn \times mn$, representing the block-diagonal matrix $A$.
# - Solve the full system $Ax = b$, using the same method you used in **2.2** for each individual sub-system. Measure the computation time needed to solve the system.
# 
# Create 4 plots, one for each value of $n$, to compare the computation time needed to solve $Ax=b$ with both methods, and how this varies with the total size of the system.

# (1) Compared with the sub-system algorithm, the full system algorithm has better time complexity;
# 
# (2) When the scale of the problem increases, the time complexity of both algorithms will increase. However, the full system formula increases in square and the sub-system algorithm increases in linear. Therefore, in the case of large n, the latter is more appropriate.
# 
# (3) According the subplot 4, the seperately calculated formula increases sharply in the interval(25,40) and remains increasing after 35, this is because for our DIY formula, it takes shorter time solving easy matrics, but for more complexed ones, the time recurring the loop will be increasingly longer as size of system increase. For the linsolve_block_diag(blocks,b), it actually ignores the zero element in the diagnal matrix.

# **3.5** Summarise and explain your observations from **3.4** in no more than 250 words. In particular, discuss how $\mathcal{D}$ should be partitioned to approximate $I$ with an error of at most $10^{-4}$, and comment on the symmetry or asymmetry of the partitioning.

# The error decreases as M and N increase as much as possible. This also shows that the smaller the area, the less error it gives.
# 
# By comparing with sin(x) and cos(y/5), if the precision of sin(x) wants to be approached to cos(x/5) there should be more points added to implement it. We can also see that m let the rate of decrease of error be more obvious. Therefore if we want to minimize the error, we should input as many points as we can.
# 
# If D should be partitioned to approximate I with an error of at most 10‚àí4, from the lower purple edge, we can conclude that N should be approaching approximately 60 or lower while M should be approaching about 200 or higher.
# 
# About the symmetry: From the graph, we can see that the symmetry area shows that the less the coutour level, there is more symmetry trend shown and vice versa.
